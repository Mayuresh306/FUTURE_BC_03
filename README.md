## ðŸ§© Task 3: Meme Creation â€“ Web3, Blockchain & Crypto

### ðŸ‘‹ Hello Everyone!

This task was part of my ongoing internship with **Future Interns** under the **Blockchain & Crypto Internship Program (Batch: FIT/JUL25/BC793)**. The objective was to create relatable, funny, and insightful memes around blockchain, Web3, and crypto to increase engagement and awareness through humor.

---

## ðŸ§  Objective

Create **fun, relatable memes** based on experiences and realities in the **Web3 and Blockchain** space. These memes are aimed at:
- Developers working with smart contracts
- NFT collectors and gas-fee survivors
- Crypto users frustrated with UI or protocol fees

---

## ðŸ“¸ Meme Previews

| Meme | Description |
|------|-------------|
| ![Solo dApp Launch Meme](./assets/supermeme_13h33_28.png) | **"Solo dApp Launch"**<br>Excitement before launching your first dApp vs. Reality after debugging errors, tracing stack logs, and crying over gas fees. A classic journey for every new Solidity developer. |
| ![Metamask Gas Fees Meme](./assets/supermeme_14h1_25.png) | **"Ethereum Moment"**<br>When you're all set to mint a $1 NFT... but Metamask hits you with a $50 gas fee. Weâ€™ve all been there. ðŸ’€|

## ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaways

- Humor is a great way to make technical communities more approachable.
- Memes can highlight **real pain points** (like gas fees, debugging, or dApp deployment hurdles).
